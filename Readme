ML SVM Module: 
This code performs a text classification task using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features. Let's go through it step by step:

Importing Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
train_test_split for splitting the dataset.
TfidfVectorizer for converting text data into TF-IDF features.
SVC from scikit-learn for SVM classification.
classification_report for evaluating the classification performance.
wordnet from NLTK for synonym replacement.
random for random operations.

Downloading NLTK Data:
The code downloads WordNet data from NLTK. WordNet is a lexical database for the English language, which includes semantic relationships between words.

Synonym Replacement Function:
synonym_replacement function takes a text input and replaces some of its words with synonyms. It iterates over each word in the text, finds its synonyms using WordNet, and replaces the word with a randomly selected synonym. This function is used for data augmentation.

Get Synonyms Function:
get_synonyms function retrieves synonyms of a given word from WordNet and preprocesses them.

Read and Preprocess Data:
Reads a CSV file assumed to have columns 'requirement' and 'reqLabel'. 'requirement' contains textual requirements, and 'reqLabel' contains their corresponding labels.
Determines the minority class in the labels.
Augments the data by replacing words in requirements of the minority class with synonyms using the synonym_replacement function.

Feature Extraction (TF-IDF):
Uses TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data into TF-IDF features. It limits the number of features to 1000.

Train/Test Split:
Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Training SVM Classifier:
Initializes an SVM classifier with a linear kernel and trains it on the training data.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the trained model on the test set using the classification_report function, which provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

Prediction Example:
Generates some new requirements.
Augments these requirements using synonym replacement.
Converts the augmented requirements into TF-IDF features.
Makes predictions on the augmented requirements using the trained SVM classifier and prints the predictions.
This code essentially demonstrates a pipeline for text classification with data augmentation using synonym replacement and evaluation of the model's performance. It's a common approach to handle imbalanced datasets and enhance the generalization capability of the model.
